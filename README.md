# Transactional Bot for Sky2Travel Company
This project involved developing a transactional bot for managing queries and orders for the fictional company Sky2Travel. As a freelance consultant hired by the company, I was asked to perform an initial demo of the project to check the feasibility of the requirements. The main objective of the project was to create a bot capable of converting a user-entered phrase into a JSON file, and generating a table or JSON file with the necessary information to process the user's request and send them the information to their mobile phone along with a direct payment link. To achieve this, a custom tagger was trained based on a corpus of at least 20 phrases or requests similar to those shown in the provided example. A virtual assistant that responds to the user's voice input was also created.
